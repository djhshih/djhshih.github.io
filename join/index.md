We are looking for new team members!

Our team creates computational and statistical methods that help us derive
novel insights from complex biological data, with an emphasize on cancer.
Our research requires the following skills:
- computer programming
- statistical modelling
- biological inference

There are three broad types of budding scientists that we are keen on
recruiting:
- [Coder](/join/postgrad/#coder)
- [Mathematician](/join/postgrad/#mathematician)
- [Scholar](/join/postgrad/#scholar)

Since we write code extensively for our research, your interview 
for most positions will involve a pair programming session. 
So, you may wish to review our curated resource list for 
[programming](/res/programming/).

Select an available position in the menu for more information.
