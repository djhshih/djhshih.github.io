We are looking for new team members!

Our team creates computational and statistical methods that help us derive
novel insights from complex biological data, with an emphasize on cancer.
Our research requires the following skills:
- computer programming
- statistical modelling
- biological inference

There are broadly three types of budding scientists that we are keen on
recruiting:
- [Skilled Coder](/join/postgrad/#skilled-coder)
- [Adept Mathematician](/join/postgrad/#adept-mathematician)
- [Elite Scholar](/join/postgrad/#elite-scholar)

Since we write code extensively for our research, the interview 
for most positions will involve a pair coding session. 
So, you may wish to review our curated resource list for 
[programming](/res/programming/).
