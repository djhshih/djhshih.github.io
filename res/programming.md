The programming languages that we most commonly use for computational
biology research are **Bash**, **R**, and **Python**.
We build pipelines for processing raw data in Bash, as well as the
Workflow Description Language ([WDL](/res/software#wdl)).
We generate plots, perform statistical analyses, and analyze 
preprocessed genomic data in R.
We also develop novel statistical models in R, often along with Stan.
Finally, we use Python for text processing as well as constructing deep
learning models.

Additionally, we sometimes re-implement parts of a program in C++ in order
to improve computational speed and efficiency. We also implement efficient
programs in C++ and Rust.

## General

In order to ensure that our work is reproducible and our code is high
quality, we adhere to common best practices of software development,
including unit testing and version control.

The **Software Carpentry** has many [high-quality lessons](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
geared towards beginners and self-learners for Shell/Bash, Python, and R.
