The most commonly used programming languages in computational biology
are Bash, R, and Python. Bash is used for building pipelines for processing
raw data. R is used for visualization, statistical analyses, genomic data
analysis, and developing novel statistical models (often with Stan).
Python is used for constructing deep learning models.

Additionally, C++ and Rust are used for implementing computationally
efficient programs.
