We apply data science to [cancer genomics][cancer-genomics] data
so that we can better understand how cancers form, evolve, and 
respond to treatment.
This knowledge can in turn help improve anti-cancer treatments and 
identify new therapeutic strategies.

Our research topics include:
- [artifact removal](/sci/artifact/)
- [mutational processes](/sci/mutproc/)
- [genomic landscape](/sci/genomic/)
- [spatial transcriptomics](/sci/st)

We are recruiting motivated research assistants and postgraduate 
students to [join our growing team](/join/).
