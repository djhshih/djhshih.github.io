## Motivation

- Spatial transcriptomics provide unique opportunities for discovering
  associations between gene expression and spatial organization of cells

## Approach

- Enhance spatial transcriptomics with statistical models and
  deep learning

## Impact

- Enable the derivation of biologlical insights from spaital
  transcriptomics data
