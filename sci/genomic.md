## Motivation

- Massive scales of genomic datasets have been generated but
  these datasets are heterogeneous and difficult to analyze collectively

- Characterize hidden structure in the data with deep learning

## Impact

- Enable discovery of new biological knowledge
- Permit the systemic comparison of different cancers
