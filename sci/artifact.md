## Problem

- Genomic data are rife with technical artifacts and measurement errors

## Approach

- Create statistical models data to detect specific patterns
  that can be attributed to known technical factors
- Normalize the data to minimize measurement noise while
  preserving signals of interest

## Impact

- Enable the distinction between artificial and real signals
- Avoid being misled by the data artifacts
- Dedicate resources to productive downstream investigations
